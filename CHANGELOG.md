# Changelog 7.0.0
## General
I switched protobuf resources to bundled steam-resources. 

## API changes
All protobuf objects are now available on Dota2.schema, removing the need for 
some of the enums declared in this package. Following enums have been removed:
 * Dota2.BotDifficulty -> Dota2.schema.DOTABotDifficulty

I also removed a bunch of deprecated functions that had been marked as such for
a few versions.

## API changes

#### ToSteamID

#### sendMessage
Order of the parameters has changed to `(message, channel_name, channel_type)`.

#### rollDice
Order of the parameters has changed to `(min, max, channel_name, channel_type)`.

#### ServerRegion
This enum used to be defined both on module level and as a member of Dota2Client.
We removed the member definition and only kept the module level one, 
in correspondence with all other enums.

#### setItemPositions
Changed the parameter type from an array of tuples to an array of objects

#### createPracticeLobby
Changed parameters to `(options, callback)` to reduce confusion. CreateTournamentLobby is now deprecated.

## Deprecation
There's a whole series of functions for which the GC hasn't responded in a long time.
Some of those were already deprecated since the last release, some of them have become deprecated since.
Those who were already deprecated for a long time have been deleted from the API.
Those who have become deprecated since the last release have been tagged deprecated.

Deprecated methods will no longer figure in the documentation (mainly because they're
now auto-magically generated based on the code comments and I really don't feel 
like adding copious amounts of documentation to a bunch of methods who no longer
can be used - shoot me). If they were one day to be re-enabled by Valve, these 
will ofcourse be documented again.

### Deleted methods
* requestProfile
* requestPassportData
* requestTeamProfile
* requestTeamMemberProfile
* requestTeamIDByName

### Deleted events
* profileData
* passportData
* teamProfile
* teamID

### Deprecated methods
* requestProTeamList
* requestGuildData
* inviteToGuild
* cancelInviteToGuild
* setGuildAccountRole

### Deprecated events
* guildOpenPartyData
* guildData
* guildInviteData
* proTeamListData
