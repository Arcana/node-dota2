A node-steam plugin for Dota 2, consider it in alpha state.

Check out @RJacksonm1's blog post (his only blog post), [Extending node-dota2](https://blog.rjackson.me/extending-node-dota2/), for a rough overview of adding new functionality to the library.
A fair warning, while the way you search for new functionality is still the same, quite a lot has changed (and been simplified) implementation wise.
It is now easier to implement new functionality than it was back when this blog was written.

## Installation and setup
* `npm install` in the repository root
* Copy `config.js.example` to `config.js` and edit appropriately
* Run the example script: `node example.js`
* If you receive Error 63 you need to provide a Steam Guard code by setting the Steam Guard code in `config.js` and launching again.
* Make sure to use at least version 4.4.5 of node js

## Initializing
Parameters:
* `steamClient` - Pass a SteamClient instance to use to send & receive GC messages.
* `debug` - A boolean noting whether to print information about operations to console.
* `debugMore` - A boolean noting whether to print extended debug information. Activating this will log messages for each proto message exchanged with the GC.

```js
var Steam = require('steam'),
    steamClient = new Steam.SteamClient(),
    dota2 = require('dota2'),
    Dota2 = new dota2.Dota2Client(steamClient, true, false);
```

## Disclaimer
We do not in any way encourage people to use their own accounts when using this library.
This library tries to mimic the behavior of the Dota 2 client to allow people to programmatically interact with the Dota 2 GC,
however we make no efforts to hide this fact and it's pretty easy for Valve to detect clients using this library based on the generated traffic.
While Valve has not yet expressed a dislike regarding reverse engineering projects like this one,
it's not unimaginable that this might one day change and result in VAC bans.

## Examples
The `examples` directory contains two Dota2 bots as an example. One contains commented-out dota2 methods, the other has boolean activated methods.
Both examples show how to interact with the library.

## Testing
There is a partial automated test suite for node-dota2, which is located in the test directory.
You need to configure the `STEAM_USERNAME` and `STEAM_PASSWORD` environment variables to be able to run it.
You can launch the tests by running the file with mocha.
