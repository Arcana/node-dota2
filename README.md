node-dota2
========

A node-steam plugin for Dota 2, consider it in alpha state.

Check out my blog post (my only blog post), [Extending node-dota2](https://blog.rjackson.me/extending-node-dota2/), for a rough overview of adding new functionality to the library.

## Upgrade guide

### `1.*.*` to `2.0.0`

A few backwards incompatible API changes were included with version 2.0.0.

* The `chatJoin` and `chatLeave` events were changed to return the channel name instead of the id. All debug logs pertaining chat channels will now mention chat channel instead of IDs.

## Initializing
Parameters:
* `steamClient` - Pass a SteamClient instance to use to send & receive GC messages.
* `debug` - A boolean noting whether to print information about operations to console.

```js
var Steam = require('steam'),
    steamClient = new Steam.SteamClient(),
    dota2 = require('dota2'),
    Dota2 = new dota2.Dota2Client(steamClient, true);
```


##Properties
###AccountID
The current steam ID of the SteamClient converted to Dota 2 Account ID format. Not available until `launch` is called.

###Lobby
The current lobby object (see CSODOTALobby). Null if the bot is not in a lobby.

###Party
The current party object (see CSODOTAParty). Null if the bot is not in a party.

###PartyInvite
The current party invite object (see CSODOTAPartyInvite). Null if the bot does not have an active incoming party invite.

## Methods
All methods require the SteamClient instance to be logged on.

### Steam
#### launch()

Reports to Steam that you're playing Dota 2, and then initiates communication with the Game Coordinator.

#### exit()

###Utilities
#### ToAccountID(steamID)
* Takes an input steam ID in any format and converts it into an int Account ID.

The groups are discoverable through `regions.txt` in Dota 2's game files.  We maintain an indicative list *without guarantees* in this README. 
This list is manually updated only when changes are detected by community members, so it can be out of date.

    "USEast":               {"matchgroup": "1"},
    "Europe":               {"matchgroup": "2"},

You can use this to detect when a lobby has been entered / created
successfully as well. Note that the `Lobby` property will be the old
value until after this event completes to allow comparison between the
two.


### `practiceLobbyJoinResponse`(`result`, `practiceLobbyJoinResponse`)
* `result` - The result object from `practiceLobbyJoinResponse`.
* `practiceLobbyJoinResponse` - The raw response object.

Emitted when the GC responds to `joinPracticeLobby` method.


### `practiceLobbyCleared` ()

Emitted when leaving a lobby (aka, the lobby is cleared). This can
happen when kicked, upon leaving a lobby, etc. There are other callbacks
to tell when the bot has been kicked.

### `practiceLobbyResponse` (`result`, `practiceLobbyResponse`)
* `result` - The result object from `practiceLobbyJoinResponse`.
* `practiceLobbyResponse` - The raw response object.

Emitted when an operation changing the state of a lobby was sent to the GC and
processed. This event only contains the acknowledgement by the GC. The actual 
update of the lobby state is communicated via `practiceLobbyUpdate` events.

### `friendPracticeLobbyListData` ()

TODO

### `joinableCustomGameModes` (`game_modes`)
* `game_modes` - List of custom game modes that are available in a given server region
  * `custom_game_id` - ID corresponding to a custom game mode
  * `lobby_count` - Number of lobbies available for the game mode
  * `player_count` - Number of players playing this game mode

Emitted when the GC responds to `requestJoinableCustomGameModes`. Never seems to return more then ten results.

### `inviteCreated` (`steam_id`, `group_id`, `is_online`)
* `steam_id` - The steam ID of the person the invite was sent to
* `group_id` - The group ID of the person the invite was sent to
* `is_online` - Whether or not the person the invite was sent to is online

Emitted when the GC has created the invitation. The invitation is only sent when
the invitee is online.

### `partyUpdate` (`party`)
* `party` - The full party object (see CSODOTAParty).


Emitted when the GC sends a party snapshot. The GC is incredibly
inefficient and will send the entire object even if it's a minor update.
You can use this to detect when a party has been entered / created
successfully as well. Note that the `Party` property will be the old
value until after this event completes to allow comparison between the
two.


### `partyCleared` ()


Emitted when leaving a party (aka, the party is cleared). This can
happen when kicked, upon leaving a party, etc. There are other callbacks
to tell when the bot has been kicked.


### `partyInviteUpdate` (`party`)
* `partyInvite` - The full party invite object (see CSODOTAPartyInvite).


Emitted when the GC sends a party invite snapshot. The GC is incredibly
inefficient and will send the entire object even if it's a minor update.
You can use this to detect when an incoming party invite has been sent.
Note that the `PartyInvite` property will be the old
value until after this event completes to allow comparison between the two.


### `partyInviteCleared` ()


Emitted when the Party Invite is cleared, for example when
accepting/rejecting it or when the party is closed.


### `liveLeagueGamesUpdate` (`null`, `liveLeaguesResponse`)
* `null` - nothing
* `liveLeaguesResponse` - Integer representing number of live league games.


### `leaguesInMonthData` (`result`, `leaguesInMonthData`)
* `result` - The result object from `leaguesInMonthData`.
* `leaguesInMonthData` - The raw response object.

Emitted when the GC responds to `requestLeaguesInMonth` method.

Notes:

* The `month` property is used to filter the data to the leagues which have matches scheduled in the given month, however the `schedule` object contains schedules for a league's entire duration - i.e. before or after `month`.
* `month` is also zero-aligned, so January = 0, Febuary = 1, March = 2, etc.
* Not every participating team seems to be hooked up to Dota 2's team system, so there will be a few `{ teamId: 0 }` objects for some schedule blocks.

The response object is visualized as follows:

```
{
    eresult,            // EResult enum
    month,              // Int representing which month this data represents.
    leagues: [{         // An array of CMsgLeague objects
        leagueId,       // ID of the league associated
        schedule: [{    // An array of CMsgLeagueScheduleBlock objects
            blockId,    // ID represending this block
            startTime,  // Unix timestamp of a scheduled match (or group of matches)
            finals,     // Boolean represending if this match is a final.
            comment,    // Comment about this scheduled block - often the team names & position in bracket
            teams: [{   // An array of CMsgLeagueScheduleBlockTeamInfo objects
                teamId, // ID of the associated team
                name,   // The teams name
                tag,    // The teams tag
                logo    // The teams logo
            }]
        }]
    }]
}
```

### `leagueData` ()

TODO

### `sourceTVGamesData` (`sourceTVGamesResponse`)
* `sourceTVGamesResponse` - The raw response object

Emitted when the GC responds to the `requestSourceTVGames` method.  Multiple events are emitted when `requestSourceTVGames` is passed with `start_game` > 0 or with one or more `lobby_id`s.

## Testing
There is no automated test suite for node-dota2 (I've no idea how I'd make one for the stuff this does :o), however there the `test` directory does contain a Steam bot with commented-out dota2 methods; you can use this bot to test the library.

### Setting up
* `npm install steam; npm install` in the repository root (install Steam first to work around a node-steam#222)
* Copy `config.js.example` to `config.js` and edit appropriately
* Run the test script: `node test.js`
* If you receive Error 63 you need to provide a Steam Guard code by setting the Steam Guard code in `config.js` and launching again.
* Make sure to use at least version 0.12 of node js
