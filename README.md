A node-steam plugin for Dota 2, consider it in alpha state.

Check out my blog post (my only blog post), [Extending node-dota2](https://blog.rjackson.me/extending-node-dota2/), for a rough overview of adding new functionality to the library.
A fair warning, while the way you search for new functionality is still the same, quite a lot has changed (and been simplified) implementation wise.
It is now easier to implement new functionality than it was back when this blog was written.

## Upgrade guide

### `3.*.*` to `4.0.0`

A few backwards incompatible API changes were included with version 4.0.0.

* The following functions are no longer supported by Valve so they have been commented:
  * `requestPassportData`
  * `requestTeamProfile`
  * `requestTeamIDByName`
  * `requestTeamMemberProfile`
* The `teamData` event now throws an extra parameter `league_id`
* The `matchMakingStatsData` event's first two parameters changed as the old values no longer exist.
* The `matchMinimalDetailsData` event now returns the `last_match` bool as first argument.

## Installation and setup
* `npm install steam; npm install` in the repository root (install Steam first to work around a node-steam#222)
* Copy `config.js.example` to `config.js` and edit appropriately
* Run the example script: `node example.js`
* If you receive Error 63 you need to provide a Steam Guard code by setting the Steam Guard code in `config.js` and launching again.
* Make sure to use at least version 4.4.5 of node js

## Initializing
Parameters:
* `steamClient` - Pass a SteamClient instance to use to send & receive GC messages.
* `debug` - A boolean noting whether to print information about operations to console.
* `debugMore` - A boolean noting whether to print extended debug information. Activating this will log messages for each proto message exchanged with the GC.

```js
var Steam = require('steam'),
    steamClient = new Steam.SteamClient(),
    dota2 = require('dota2'),
    Dota2 = new dota2.Dota2Client(steamClient, true, false);
```

## Examples
The `examples` directory contains two Dota2 bots as an example. One contains commented-out dota2 methods, the other has boolean activated methods. 
Both examples show how to interact with the library.

## Testing
There is a partial automated test suite for node-dota2, which is located in the test directory. 
You need to configure the `STEAM_USERNAME` and `STEAM_PASSWORD` environment variables to be able to run it.
You can launch the tests by running the file with mocha.

##Properties
###AccountID
The current steam ID of the SteamClient converted to Dota 2 Account ID format. Not available until `launch` is called.

###Lobby
The current lobby object (see CSODOTALobby). Null if the bot is not in a lobby.

###Party
The current party object (see CSODOTAParty). Null if the bot is not in a party.

###PartyInvite
The current party invite object (see CSODOTAPartyInvite). Null if the bot does not have an active incoming party invite.

###LobbyInvite
The current lobby invite object (see CSODOTALobbyInvite). Null if the bot does not have an active incoming lobby invite.

## Methods
All methods require the SteamClient instance to be logged on.

The groups are discoverable through `regions.txt` in Dota 2's game files.  We maintain an indicative list *without guarantees* in this README. 
This list is manually updated only when changes are detected by community members, so it can be out of date. 
Here are the groups at the time of this sentence being written (with unecessary data trimmed out):

```
    "USWest":                       {"matchgroup": "0"},
    "USEast":                       {"matchgroup": "1"},

Emitted when the GC responds to the `requestTopFriendMatches` method.


### `practiceLobbyUpdate` (`lobby`)
* `lobby` - The full lobby object (see CSODOTALobby).


Emitted when the GC sends a lobby snapshot. The GC is incredibly
inefficient and will send the entire object even if it's a minor update.
You can use this to detect when a lobby has been entered / created
successfully as well. Note that the `Lobby` property will be the old
value until after this event completes to allow comparison between the
two.


### `lobbyInviteCleared` ()

Emitted when the Lobby Invite is cleared, for example when
accepting/rejecting it or when the lobby is closed.



### `practiceLobbyJoinResponse`(`result`, `practiceLobbyJoinResponse`)
* `result` - The result object from `practiceLobbyJoinResponse`.
* `practiceLobbyJoinResponse` - The raw response object.

Emitted when the GC responds to `joinPracticeLobby` method.


### `practiceLobbyCleared` ()

Emitted when leaving a lobby (aka, the lobby is cleared). This can
happen when kicked, upon leaving a lobby, etc. There are other callbacks
to tell when the bot has been kicked.

### `practiceLobbyResponse` (`result`, `practiceLobbyResponse`)
* `result` - The result object from `practiceLobbyJoinResponse`.
* `practiceLobbyResponse` - The raw response object.

Emitted when an operation changing the state of a lobby was sent to the GC and
processed. This event only contains the acknowledgement by the GC. The actual 
update of the lobby state is communicated via `practiceLobbyUpdate` events.

### `friendPracticeLobbyListData` ()

TODO

### `joinableCustomGameModes` (`game_modes`)
* `game_modes` - List of custom game modes that are available in a given server region
  * `custom_game_id` - ID corresponding to a custom game mode
  * `lobby_count` - Number of lobbies available for the game mode
  * `player_count` - Number of players playing this game mode

Emitted when the GC responds to `requestJoinableCustomGameModes`. Never seems to return more then ten results.

### `inviteCreated` (`steam_id`, `group_id`, `is_online`)
* `steam_id` - The steam ID of the person the invite was sent to
* `group_id` - The group ID of the person the invite was sent to
* `is_online` - Whether or not the person the invite was sent to is online

Emitted when the GC has created the invitation. The invitation is only sent when
the invitee is online.

### `partyUpdate` (`party`)
* `party` - The full party object (see CSODOTAParty).


Emitted when the GC sends a party snapshot. The GC is incredibly
inefficient and will send the entire object even if it's a minor update.
You can use this to detect when a party has been entered / created
successfully as well. Note that the `Party` property will be the old
value until after this event completes to allow comparison between the
two.


### `partyCleared` ()


Emitted when leaving a party (aka, the party is cleared). This can
happen when kicked, upon leaving a party, etc. There are other callbacks
to tell when the bot has been kicked.


### `partyInviteUpdate` (`party`)
* `partyInvite` - The full party invite object (see CSODOTAPartyInvite).


Emitted when the GC sends a party invite snapshot. The GC is incredibly
inefficient and will send the entire object even if it's a minor update.
You can use this to detect when an incoming party invite has been sent.
Note that the `PartyInvite` property will be the old
value until after this event completes to allow comparison between the two.


### `partyInviteCleared` ()


Emitted when the Party Invite is cleared, for example when
accepting/rejecting it or when the party is closed.


### `liveLeagueGamesUpdate` (`null`, `liveLeaguesResponse`)
* `null` - nothing
* `liveLeaguesResponse` - Integer representing number of live league games.


### `leaguesInMonthData` (`month`, `year`, `leagues`)
* `month` - Int representing which month this data represents.
* `year` - Int representing which year this data represents.
* `leagues` - Array of CMsgLeague objects

Emitted when the GC responds to `requestLeaguesInMonth` method.

Notes:

* The `month` property is used to filter the data to the leagues which have matches scheduled in the given month, however the `schedule` object contains schedules for a league's entire duration - i.e. before or after `month`.
* `month` is also zero-aligned, so January = 0, Febuary = 1, March = 2, etc.
* Not every participating team seems to be hooked up to Dota 2's team system, so there will be a few `{ teamId: 0 }` objects for some schedule blocks.

The leagues object is visualized as follows:

```
leagues: [{         // An array of CMsgLeague objects
    leagueId,       // ID of the league associated
    schedule: [{    // An array of CMsgLeagueScheduleBlock objects
        blockId,    // ID represending this block
        startTime,  // Unix timestamp of a scheduled match (or group of matches)
        finals,     // Boolean represending if this match is a final.
        comment,    // Comment about this scheduled block - often the team names & position in bracket
        teams: [{   // An array of CMsgLeagueScheduleBlockTeamInfo objects
            teamId, // ID of the associated team
            name,   // The teams name
            tag,    // The teams tag
            logo    // The teams logo
        }]
    }]
}]
```
